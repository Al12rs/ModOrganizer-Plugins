        "Someone else started developing a mod organizer plugin whose imports clashed with this one. While that plugin was changed, it's still safer to update this so it can't happen again with anyone else's plugins.",
        "Moved glob import to the specific scope where it's used so it doesn't overwrite anyone else's glob and doesn't get overwritten. This needed doing because the glob namespace contains the glob function, so different import styles will redefine one as the other."
